# Wdio File Reporter

Wdio File Reporter is a reporter that logs wdio test output to separate files based on locale, theme and form-factor with the following attributes

- date and time of when the tests are started and when they are finished

- Locale, Form Factor and Theme of the tests 

- Name of the tests and whether they've succeeded or failed

***WDIO test output Directory ***
Terra WDIO spec Reporter logs the WDIO test output in tests/wdio/reports/results or test/wdio/reports/results depending on whether tests or test is the directory with tests

***Check for Mono Repo**
Terra WDIO spec Reporter assumes mono-repo will have packages directory in the root folder

## Usage

Add WdioFileReporter as an additional reporter within the wdio.config file. Include "dot" to avoid overriding default reporters

```javascript

const WdioFileReporter = require('terra-toolkit/src/wdio/WdioFileReporter');
{
 reporters: ['dot', WdioFileReporter],
}

```
## Report Format
- The name of the log file will be **result-\<locale>-\<theme>-\<form-factor>.json**(eg: result-en-huge.json)
